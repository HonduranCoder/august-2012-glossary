| express | Express is a back-end framework for Node.js that allows you to start and configure a server with very little overhead. It's free, open-source, and is written in JavaScript. |     |     |   |
| framework  |  A framework is a structure that you can build software on. It serves as a foundation, so you're not starting entirely from scratch. Frameworks are typically associated with a specific programming language and are suited to different types of tasks.   |     |     | https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-framework/  |
| Node.js  | Node.js is a JavaScript runtime (i.e. a way to convert JavaScript into machine code) that allows developers to use JavaScript outside of the web browser. Originally, JavaScript was invented as a way to add interactivity to websites, but it couldn't be used in other areas like writing programs for operating robotics or interacting with a computer's filesystem. Node.js frees JavaScript from the browser so you can use the language in other domains, like building command-line applications or backend APIs. |     |     |  |
